## History

Kit was initially created by Sam Maddox, in collaboration with his professors, as a new Learning Management System for the Computer Science department at Kalamazoo College in 2015. Kit was designed to address shortcomings in existing software, while combining the best features available elsewhere. While the ability to host git repositories is a computer-science specific utility, it is otherwise useful for any field of study.
